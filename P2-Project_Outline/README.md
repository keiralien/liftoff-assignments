## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a tracking app for cooking recipes. I've wanted something I can use to store and track recipes
that I don't have to use on my phone. The app will store recipe information including ingredients, directions
and serving information. Recipes can be assigned a name, description, and various categories. Recipes can then
be searched by name, category or ingredient and display the information appropriately. It will have a random 
function to let a user return an unselected recipe.

all their recipes.
